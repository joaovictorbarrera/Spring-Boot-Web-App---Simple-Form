### COP 3330 Project 8: Greeting

This program uses the Spring Boot framework to spin up a web application. The GET for /greeting retrieves a form where you can enter your Student ID, a message and a date. After submitting the form, a results page will display the data entered.

This application uses Thymeleaf as a dependency. Depencies are managed with a pom.xml file.

Use localhost:8080/greeting to view form
